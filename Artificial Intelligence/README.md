## Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains coursework for the Artificial Intelligence module, focused on evolutionary computation and optimisation using genetic algorithms.

The project investigates how virtual creatures can evolve locomotion strategies to climb a mountain. I designed, implemented, and evaluated multiple fitness functions and evolutionary constraints, analysing how mutation rates, population size, morphology limits, and control parameters affect learning outcomes.

Key work includes:
- Designing and refining fitness functions to prevent exploitative behaviour and encourage meaningful movement
- Conducting controlled experiments across 300 generations to compare evolutionary performance
- Analysing convergence, stability, and failure cases using quantitative fitness metrics
- Evaluating generalisation by testing evolved agents on noisy and uneven terrain

Key skills demonstrated:
- Genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimisation
- Experimental design and parameter tuning
- Critical analysis of algorithmic behaviour and limitations
- Translating theoretical AI concepts into working simulations
