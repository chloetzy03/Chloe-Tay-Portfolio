## Web Development

This repository contains a front-end web development project completed as part of a Web Development module in my Computer Science degree.

The project involved designing and implementing a responsive photography magazine website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features multiple interconnected pages, including a homepage, gallery, photographers directory, stories section, and an accompanying design report outlining usability, accessibility, and design decisions.

Key focus areas included responsive layout design, accessibility considerations, and user experience. Media queries were used to ensure the website adapts across desktop and mobile devices, while structured navigation and visual hierarchy were implemented to improve usability. JavaScript was used to support interactive components such as navigation behaviour and modal elements.

The repository includes all source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), assets, and a written design report documenting inspiration, accessibility, usability, and evaluation.
