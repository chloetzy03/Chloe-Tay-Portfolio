## Machine Learning and Neural Networks

This repository contains two projects completed for the Machine Learning and Neural Networks module as part of my Computer Science Degree.

Project 1 focuses on classical machine learning techniques, where multiple classification models were implemented and compared on the Iris dataset. The work involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, implementing k-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes from scratch, and evaluating Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using cross-validation and performance metrics.

Project 2 follows the universal workflow from Deep Learning with Python (DLWP), implementing supervised neural network models in TensorFlow using Sequential Dense and Dropout layers only. The project emphasises structured experimentation, model evaluation, and technical reporting within a Jupyter notebook.

Key skills demonstrated:
- Machine learning and neural network fundamentals
- Model implementation, training, and evaluation
- Experimental design and performance analysis
- Technical documentation and reporting
