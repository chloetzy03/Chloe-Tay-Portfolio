## The Last Spark

This repository contains my final year project titled The Last Spark, a real-time 3D animated short created in Unity. The project follows a fire character travelling through a frozen environment, using visual change rather than dialogue to convey themes of struggle, sacrifice, and renewal.

The project focuses on real-time graphics and animation techniques, including custom shaders, particle effects, and cinematic sequencing. Shader Graph was used to create animated fire, snow, and dissolve effects, while VFX Graph handled particle-based elements such as embers, snowfall, and the final bloom sequence. Unity Timeline and Cinemachine were used to choreograph animation, camera movement, and visual transitions.

Development was iterative, with visual and technical decisions refined through user feedback, observation, and performance testing using Unity Profiler. Particular attention was paid to keeping the project visually expressive while maintaining stable real-time performance on mid-range hardware.

Overall, this project reflects hands-on experience working with real-time rendering, shaders, visual effects, animation systems, and performance considerations within a modern game engine workflow.
